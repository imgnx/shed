.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBshed\fR provides human\-friendly control over process priority and QoS classes
on macOS and Linux by wrapping native tools.
.PP
On macOS it uses \fBtaskpolicy\fR (and \fBrenice\fR); on Linux it prefers
\fBsystemd\-run\fR transient scopes with CPU/IO weights and falls back to
\fBnice\fR/\fBionice\fR when systemd is unavailable.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B bg
Deprioritize a matching process group or run a command in background tier.
.TP
.B work
Run at normal/interactive\-initiated tier.
.TP
.B focus
Run at interactive tier for responsiveness.
.TP
.B bump \fIpid\fR
Temporarily boost an existing process by PID.
.SH NOTES
If invoked with a single word that matches a running process (via \fBpgrep\fR \-f),
\fBshed\fR treats it as a process pattern; otherwise, it treats arguments as a command to run.
.SH EXAMPLES
.EX
shed bg pm2
shed focus npm install
shed bump 12345
.EE
.SH EXIT STATUS
Returns 0 on success; non\-zero on error. Unsupported OS returns 2.
