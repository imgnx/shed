# shed
> Shed load. Shed weight. Shed light.

**shed** is a tiny cross-platform CLI that gives you human-friendly control over process priority:
- macOS: wraps `taskpolicy` (+ `renice`)
- Linux: wraps `systemd-run --user --scope` (+ `nice`/`ionice` fallback)

## Install
```sh
# quick local install
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSER/shed.git
cd shed
chmod +x bin/shed
sudo ln -sf "$PWD/bin/shed" /usr/local/bin/shed
# (optional) Zsh helper
echo "source $PWD/contrib/zsh/focus-burst.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
 # (optional) completions + man page via installer
 PREFIX=/usr/local bash install.sh
```

## Usage
```sh
shed bg pm2             # deprioritize all matching processes
shed bg cloudflared
shed focus npm install  # run command at interactive priority
shed work long-task     # normal tier
shed bump 12345         # temporarily boost a PID
```

### Behavior
- **Patterns**: a single word (e.g. `pm2`) treats it as a process pattern (pgrep -f).
- **Commands**: otherwise, runs the provided command under the mode.
- **Linux systemd**: if available, uses a transient scope with CPU/IO weights.
- **Fallbacks**: Linux w/o systemd ‚Üí `nice`/`ionice`. macOS ‚Üí QoS via `taskpolicy`.

### Shell completions
- Bash: installs to `$PREFIX/share/bash-completion/completions/shed`
- Zsh: installs to `$PREFIX/share/zsh/site-functions/_shed`
- Fish: installs to `$PREFIX/share/fish/vendor_completions.d/shed.fish`

### Man page
If `$PREFIX/share/man/man1` exists, `install.sh` installs `docs/shed.1.gz`.

## UNRESTRICTIONS

This project imposes **no extra restrictions** beyond the MIT License. In plain English:

- ‚úÖ You may **use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sell** this software (including as part of a commercial/closed-source product or hosted service).
- ‚úÖ You may **fork** it, **vendor** it, **bundle** it, and **rename** your fork.
- ‚úÖ You may **automate** it, **script** it, and **embed** it in other tools.
- ‚úÖ No CLA, no registration, no telemetry, no ‚Äúphone-home,‚Äù no forced updates.
- ‚úÖ No ‚Äúopen-core‚Äù feature gating. The repo contains everything you need.

The only obligations are the standard MIT ones:
- üìé **Keep the license and copyright notice** in source or ‚Äúsubstantial portions.‚Äù
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No warranty**: see the MIT text for the ‚Äúas is‚Äù disclaimer.

**Notes**
- Using the name ‚Äúshed‚Äù to refer to this project is fine; no logo/trademark program here. If you publish a derivative under a new name, just don‚Äôt imply endorsement.
- If your company needs a one-liner for legal: ‚ÄúNo additional restrictions beyond MIT. No telemetry.‚Äù 
- If you‚Äôre packaging for distros or app stores, include `LICENSE` in your package.

## Why?
Developers often need to:
- push daemons into the background tier,
- keep editors/REPLs snappy,
- temporarily boost a single heavy command.
Existing tools exist but aren‚Äôt unified or ergonomic. **shed** glues them together.

## License
MIT ‚Äî see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Development
- Tests: `make test`
- Lint (optional): `make lint` (uses `shellcheck` if available)
- Install locally: `make install` (respects `PREFIX`, defaults to `/usr/local`)

### Running tests
Tests are plain shell scripts in `tests/`. The runner executes any `test_*.sh`.

```sh
make test
```

### Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Packaging
- Homebrew (tap): create a formula pointing at a release tarball and install to `/usr/local/bin`. See `install.sh` for completions/manpage paths.
- Debian/apt: package `bin/shed` to `/usr/bin/shed`, include `docs/shed.1`, and install completions under standard locations.
