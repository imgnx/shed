# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include welcoming language, being respectful of differing viewpoints, accepting constructive criticism, and focusing on whatâ€™s best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include sexualized language or imagery, trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, public or private harassment, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Scope
This Code applies within all community spaces and when an individual is officially representing the community.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a private security advisory or contacting the maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).
